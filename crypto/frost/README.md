# Modular FROST

A modular implementation of FROST for any curve with a ff/group API. Notably,
beyond curve modularity, custom algorithms may be specified, providing support
for privacy coins. The provided Schnorr algorithm also has a modular HRAM due
to the variety in existence, enabling integration with existing systems.

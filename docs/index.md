may become out-of-date (as Serai is an evolving protocol yet to release) or have

# Serai

Serai is a fairly launched cross-chain decentralized exchange, integrating
Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH, DAI), and Monero (XMR).

The Serai mainnet has yet to launch, and until then, all details are subject to
change.

Prior to the Serai mainnet launching, SRI, Serai's native coin, will not
exist. As a fairly launched project, SRI will have no ICO, no IEO, no presale,
no developers' tax/fund, and no airdrop for out-of-mainnet activity.

Out-of-mainnet activity includes:

- Being a community member (such as on Discord or on Twitter)
- Participating in testnets
- Contributing to the GitHub

None of these will be awarded any airdrop. All distributions of SRI will happen
on-chain per the protocols' defined rules, based on on-chain activity.

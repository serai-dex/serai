# Serai

Serai is a decentralized execution layer whose validators form multisig wallets
for various connected networks, offering secure decentralized control of foreign
coins to applications built on it.

Serai is exemplified by Serai DEX, an automated-market-maker (AMM) decentralized
exchange, allowing swapping Bitcoin, Ether, DAI, and Monero. It is the premier
application of Serai.

### Substrate

Serai is based on [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io), a blockchain framework
offering a robust infrastructure.

# In Instructions

In Instructions are included onto the Serai blockchain via unsigned
transactions. In order to ensure the integrity of the included instructions, the
validator set responsible for the network in question produces a threshold
signature of their authenticity.

This lets all other validators verify the instructions with an O(1) operation.

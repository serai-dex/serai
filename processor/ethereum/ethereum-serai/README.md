# Ethereum

This package contains Ethereum-related functionality, specifically deploying and
interacting with Serai contracts.

While `monero-serai` and `bitcoin-serai` are general purpose libraries,
`ethereum-serai` is Serai specific. If any of the utilities are generally
desired, please fork and maintain your own copy to ensure the desired
functionality is preserved, or open an issue to request we make this library
general purpose.

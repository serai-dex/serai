      The document says to only handle outputs we created. We don't know what outputs we
      created. We do have an ordered view of equivalent outputs however, and can assume the
      first (and likely only) ones are the ones we created.

      Accordingly, only handling outputs we created should be definable as only handling
      outputs from the resolution of Eventualities.

      This isn't feasible. It requires knowing what Eventualities were completed in this block,
      when we handle this block, which we don't know without fully serialized scanning + Batch
      publication.

      Take the following scenario:
      1) A network uses 10 confirmations. Block x is scanned, meaning x+9a exists.
      2) 67% of nodes process x, create, sign, and publish a TX, creating an Eventuality.
      3) A reorganization to a shorter chain occurs, including the published TX in x+1b.
      4) The 33% of nodes which are latent will be allowed to scan x+1b as soon as x+10b
         exists. They won't wait for Serai to include the Batch for x until they try to scan
         x+10b.
      5) These latent nodes will handle x+1b, post-create an Eventuality, post-learn x+1b
         contained resolutions, changing how x+1b should've been interpreted.

      We either have to:
      A) Fully serialize scanning (removing the ability to utilize throughput to allow higher
         latency, at least while the step is `ClosingExisting`).
      B) Create Eventualities immediately, which we can't do as then both the external
         network's clock AND Serai's clock can trigger Eventualities, removing ordering.
         We'd need to shift entirely to the external network's clock, only handling Burns
         outside the parallelization window (which would be extremely latent).
      C) Use a different mechanism to determine if we created an output.
      D) Re-define which outputs are still to be handled after the 6 hour period expires, such
         that the multisig's lifetime cannot be further extended yet it does fulfill its
         responsibility.

      External outputs to the existing multisig will be:
      - Scanned before the rotation and unused (as used External outputs become Change)
      - Forwarded immediately upon scanning
      - Not scanned before the cut off time (and accordingly dropped)

      For the first case, since they're scanned before the rotation and unused, they'll be
      forwarded with all other available outputs (since they'll be available when scanned).

      Change outputs will be:
      - Scanned before the rotation and forwarded with all other available outputs
      - Forwarded immediately upon scanning
      - Not scanned before the cut off time, requiring an extension exclusive to these outputs

      The important thing to note about honest Change outputs to the existing multisig is that
      they'll only be created within `CONFIRMATIONS+1` blocks of the activation block. Also
      important to note is that there's another explicit window of `CONFIRMATIONS` before the
      6 hour window.

      Eventualities are not guaranteed to be known before we scan the block containing their
      resolution. They are guaranteed to be known within `CONFIRMATIONS-1` blocks however, due
      to the limitation on how far we'll scan ahead.

      This means we will know of all Eventualities related to Change outputs we need to forward
      before the 6 hour period begins (as forwarding outputs will not create any Change outputs
      to the existing multisig).

      This means a definition of complete can be defined as:
      1) Handled all Branch outputs
      2) Forwarded all External outputs received before the end of 6 hour window
      3) Forwarded the results of all Eventualities with Change, which will have been created
         before the 6 hour window

      How can we track and ensure this without needing to check if an output is from the
      resolution of an Eventuality?

      1) We only create Branch outputs before the 6 hour window starts. These are guaranteed
         to appear within `CONFIRMATIONS` blocks. They will exist with arbitrary depth however,
         meaning that upon completion they will spawn several more Eventualities. The further
         created Eventualities re-risk being present after the 6 hour period ends.

         We can:
         1) Build a queue for Branch outputs, delaying their handling until relevant
            Eventualities are guaranteed to be present.

            This solution would theoretically work for all outputs and allow collapsing this
            problem to simply:

            > Accordingly, only handling outputs we created should be definable as only
              handling outputs from the resolution of Eventualities.

         2) Create all Eventualities under a Branch at time of Branch creation.
            This idea fails as Plans are tightly bound to outputs.

         3) Don't track Branch outputs by Eventualities, yet by the amount of Branch outputs
            remaining. Any Branch output received, of a useful amount, is assumed to be our
            own and handled. All other Branch outputs, even if they're the completion of some
            Eventuality, are dropped.

            This avoids needing any additional queue, avoiding additional pipelining/latency.

      2) External outputs are self-evident. We simply stop handling them at the cut-off point,
         and only start checking after `CONFIRMATIONS` blocks if all Eventualities are
         complete.

      3) Since all Change Eventualities will be known prior to the 6 hour window's beginning,
         we can safely check if a received Change output is the resolution of an Eventuality.
         We only need to forward it if so. Forwarding it simply requires only checking if
         Eventualities are complete after `CONFIRMATIONS` blocks, same as for straggling
         External outputs.

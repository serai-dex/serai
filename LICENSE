Serai crates are licensed under one of two licenses, either MIT or AGPL-3.0,
depending on the crate in question. Each crate declares their license in their
`Cargo.toml` and includes a `LICENSE` file detailing its status. Additionally,
a full copy of the AGPL-3.0 License is included in the root of this repository
as a reference text. This copy should be provided with any distribution of a
crate licensed under the AGPL-3.0, as per its terms.

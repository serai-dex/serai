# Monero Bulletproofs(+)

Bulletproofs(+) range proofs, as defined by the Monero protocol.

This library is usable under no-std when the `std` feature (on by default) is
disabled.

### Cargo Features

- `std` (on by default): Enables `std` (and with it, more efficient internal
  implementations).
- `compile-time-generators` (on by default): Derives the generators at
  compile-time so they don't need to be derived at runtime. This is recommended
  if program size doesn't need to be kept minimal.
